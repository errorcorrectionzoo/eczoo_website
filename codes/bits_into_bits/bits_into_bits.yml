code_id: bits_into_bits

name: 'Binary error-correcting code'

description: 'Encodes \(K\) bitstrings (codewords) into bitstrings of length \(n\) and has distance \(d\). Usually denoted as \((n,K,d)\), or \([n,k,d]\) when \(K=2^k\). The distance is the number of nonzero entries in the (nonzero) codeword with the smallest such number.'

protection: 'Detects errors on up to \(d-1\) coordinates, corrects erasure errors on up to \(d-1\) coordinates, and corrects general errors on up to \(\left\lfloor (d-1)/2 \right\rfloor\) coordinates.'

features: ''
