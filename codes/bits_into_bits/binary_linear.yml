name: 'Binary linear code'

description: 'An \((n,2^k,d)\) linear code is denoted as \([n,k,d]\). Its codewords form a linear subspace, i.e., for any codewords \(x,y\), \(x+y\) is also a codeword. Often defined in terms of a generator matrix \(G\), whose rows form a basis for the subspace. Given a codeword labeled by a binary string \(v\), the corresponding encoded codeword is \(G^T v\).'

protection: 'A classical code with distance \(d\) detects errors on up to \(d-1\) coordinates, and corrects general errors on up to \(\left\lfloor (d-1)/2 \right\rfloor\) coordinates. Distance \(d\) of a linear code is the number of nonzero entries in the (nonzero) codeword with the smallest such number. Generally, linear codes correct any error set such that no two elements of the set add up to a codeword.'

features: 'Admits a parity check matrix \(H\), whose columns make up a maximal linearly independent set of vectors that are in the kernel of \(G\).'
