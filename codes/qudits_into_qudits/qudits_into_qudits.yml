code_id: qudits_into_qudits

name: 'Qudit error-correcting code'

description: 'Encodes \(K\)-dimensional Hilbert space into a \(q^n\)-dimensional (\(n\)-qudit) Hilbert space for some \(q\); has distance \(d\). Usually denoted as \(((n,K,d))_q\), or \([[n,k,d]]_q\) when \(K=q^k\). The distance is the minimum weight of an error that implements a nontrivial logical operation on the code.'

protection: 'Detects errors on up to \(d-1\) qubits, and corrects erasure errors on up to \(d-1\) qubits.'

features: ''
