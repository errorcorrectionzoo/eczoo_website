Codewords \\(c_1 c_2 \\cdots c_n\\) of a \\(q\\)-ary Galois-field code can be thought of as coefficients in a polynomial \\(c_1+c_2 x+\\cdots+c_n x^{n-1}\\) in the set of polynomials with \\(q\\)-ary coefficients, \\(\\mathbb{F}_q[x]\\) with \\(\\mathbb{F}_q=GF(q)\\). Polynomials corresponding to codewords of a linear cyclic code form an ideal (i.e., are closed under multiplication and addition) in the ring \\(\\mathbb{F}_q[x]/(x^n-1)\\) (i.e., the set of equivalence classes of polynomials congruent modulo \\(x^n-1\\)). Multiplication of a codeword polynomial \\(c(x)\\) by \\(x\\) in such a ring corresponds to a cyclic shift of the corresponding codeword string.\n\\end{defterm}\n\nCodeword polynomials of a cyclic code can be generated, via multiplication, by a \\textit{generator polynomial} \\(g(x)\\). A particular generator polynomial \\(e(x)\\) has the additional property of being \\textit{idempotent}, i.e., \\(e(x)^2=e(x)\\). Given a generator polynomial, the corresponding \\textit{check polynomial} \\(h(x)=(x^n-1)/g(x)\\) yields zero when multiplying a codeword polynomial. Its coefficients correspond to the code's parity check matrix.\n\nSince the generator polynomial \\(g(x)\\) is a polynomial over \\(GF(q)\\), it can be factorized over some potentially larger \\textit{splitting field} (just like \\(x^2+1\\) can be factorized over the complex numbers but not the reals). Whenever \\(q\\) and \\(n\\) are relatively prime, cyclic codes can also be defined in terms of roots of \\(g(x)\\). Such roots are called \\textit{zeroes} of the code, and they are all powers of a primitive \\(n\\)th root of unity because \\(g(x)\\) is a divisor of \\(x^n-1\\).

Haar-random codes are used to prove statements about the capacity of a quantum channel to transmit quantum information \\cite{arXiv:1106.1445}, but encoding and decoding in such \\(n\\)-qubit codes quickly becomes impractical as \\(n\\to\\infty\\).\n\nThere are different approaches to create Haar-random codewords. In the construction of Ref. \\cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0702005}, codewords are produced by performing a unitarily covariant projective measurement on a \\textit{typical} subspace of a tensor-power state.

In particular, Haar-random codes achieve perfect transmission in the \\(n\\to\\infty\\)) limit by proving that the encoded information becomes decoupled from the environment. This is a necessary and sufficient condition for successful decoding since measurements of the environment should never reveal the encoded information \\cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9604022}.\n\nIntuitively, coupling with the environment can be decreased by projecting the system onto a random codespace. The more qubits that are randomly discarded, the more the codespace is decoupled from the environment. One may ask what is the least amount of qubits that can be discarded, i.e. the largest remaining codespace, that still achieves decoupling. It can be shown through the decoupling inequality \\cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0512247} that the largest possible dimension of the random codespace that achieves arbitrarily large decoupling is exponential in the coherent information of the channel. Therefore, there exist codes that can transmit information with rate equal to the coherent information. Furthermore, these codes can be constructed with high probability by performing a Haar-random isometry embedding a \\(k\\)-dimensional logical subspace into an \\(n\\)-dimensional physical space, where \\(k/n\\) is equal to the coherent information.

Note that this doesnt lead to new codes but does lead to new error correction and fault tolerance procedures. Subsystem codes are denoted by \\([[n,k,r,d]]\\), similar to stabilizer codes, but with an extra parameter \\(r\\) denoting the number of gauge qubits.\n\nTo create these codes proceed as follows. Choose \\(2n\\) operators \\(\\{ \\tilde{X}_j,\\tilde{Z}_j\\}_{j=1}^n\\) from \\(\\mathsf{P}_n\\), the Pauli group on \\(n\\) qubits, such that they obey the same commutation relations as the regular \\(n\\)-qubit Pauli generators \\( \\{X_j,Z_j\\}_{j=1}^n \\) (the subscript on these latter operators indicates the single qubit the Pauli matrix acts on). The tilde operators might act on more than one physical (or \\textit{bare}) qubit but they behave as if they acted only on a single qubit. WLOG we can choose a stabilizer group as \\( \\mathsf{S} = \\langle Z_1,\\dots,Z_s \\rangle \\). It follows that the normalizer of \\(\\mathsf{S} \\) is \\( N(\\mathsf{S}) = \\langle i, \\tilde{Z}_1,\\dots, \\tilde{Z}_n, \\tilde{X}_{s+1},\\dots, \\tilde{X}_n \\rangle \\). We now choose a gauge group as \\( \\mathsf{G} = \\langle i, \\tilde{Z}_1,\\dots, \\tilde{Z}_s, \\tilde{X}_{s+1}, \\tilde{Z}_{s+1}, \\dots, \\tilde{X}_{s+r}, \\tilde{Z}_{s+r} \\rangle \\) with \\( s + r \\leq n \\). The logical group is choosen as \\( \\mathsf{L} = N(\\mathsf{S})/\\mathsf{G} \\simeq \\langle \\tilde{X}_{s+r+1},\\tilde{Z}_{s+r+1}, \\dots, \\tilde{X}_n,\\tilde{Z}_n \\rangle \\). Now the codespace \\( C \\) is as usual the \\(+1\\) eigenspace of the stabilizer \\( \\mathsf{S} \\). But the gauge and logical groups have further decomposed this space into \\( C = A \\otimes B \\simeq (\\mathbb{C}^2)^{\\otimes k} \\otimes (\\mathbb{C}^2)^{\\otimes r} \\). Thus the Hilbert space is partitioned into 3 sets; \\(k\\) logical qubits, \\(r\\) gauge qubits, and \\(s\\) stabilizer qubits, with \\(s+r+k=n\\).\n", "name": "Subsystem qubit stabilizer code", "introduced": "\\cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0508131}", "features": {"threshold": [], "general_gates": [], "magic_scaling_exponent": "", "fault_tolerance": [], "decoders": ["Syndrome measurements are obtained by first measuring gauge operators of the code and taking their products, which give the stabilizer measurement outcomes."], "transversal_gates": "", "code_capacity_threshold": ["For correlated Pauli noise, bounds can be obtained by mapping the effect of noise on the code to a statistical mechanical model \\cite{arXiv:1809.10704}."], "rate": "", "encoders": []}, "physical": "qubits", "protection": "Detects errors on \\(d-1\\) qubits, corrects errors on \\(\\left\\lfloor (d-1)/2 \\right\\rfloor\\) qubits.
